       <h1 style="text-align: center;"> What does it mean to live off the Grid?</h1>

       <div class="explain" style="text-align: center;"> Off-the-grid or off-grid is a characteristic of buildings 
        and a lifestyle designed in an independent manner without 
        reliance on one or more public utilities. The term "off-the-grid" 
        traditionally refers to not being connected to the electrical grid, 
        but can also include other utilities like water, gas, and sewer 
        systems, and can scale from residential homes to small communities. 
        Off-the-grid living allows for buildings and people to be self-sufficient, 
        which is advantageous in isolated locations where normal utilities cannot 
        reach and is attractive to those who want to reduce environmental 
        impact and cost of living. Generally, an off-grid building must be able 
        to supply energy and potable water for itself, as well as manage 
        food, waste and wastewater. </p> </div>
